# Frontend Web Development
## Organized by [CareerTek](https://hendrickscareertek.org/)

This class is an introduction to frontend web development. Frontend refers to the part of a website that runs on your computer. The goal of this class is to provide an understanding of how websites function, the knowledge to create them, and the strategies to teach oneself beyond the scope of the class.

For now, you can read the [Getting Started Page](/getting-started) to learn about the class, make your first webpage, and install a code editor onto your computer.
