# Getting Started

## How this class will work

This class differs from most in two ways. The first is that it is project based, and the second is that due to Covid 19, it will be remote.

### Projects

As the technology has reduced the cost of replicating information (think downloading an audiobook vs copying an entire book by hand), the amount that one has memorized has become far less important than their ability to acquire and apply information. In other words, it's more important to understand algebra than to know your times tables. This belief is at the core of our class structure; and as such, this class will use projects to teach students how to apply information.

### Timing
As we won't be able to meet in person, this class will be held over the internet using tools like google hangouts, slack, and this website. Additionally, I will be able to help students work through problems they have trouble with using the teletype plugin for atom that we install below.

## Your First Website

A webpage is an HTML file (text file) containing content surrounded by tags. A tag looks like `<tag>content</tag>`. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) is a website that lets you experiment with the web. Try entering the text below into the HTML tab of the [codepen editor](https://codepen.io/pen).

```html
Hello World!
```

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

```html
<i>Hello World!</i>
```

The text inside the brackets is the tag name. Try using an `i` tag within an `h1` tag.

## Tools to Install

To edit websites on your computer, you just need a text editor. Most computers come with built in text editors, but to get features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete, we are going to install a text editor called atom. Atom runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and integrates with a tool called git that we will use to store the history of our code. Instructions for installing atom and git can be found on their respective websites below.

### Installation instructions:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* [atom](https://atom.io/)

### Atom plugins

The atom editor can be customized with plugins and themes. For this class we will only need the `teletype` plugin, which will allow you to share your coding environment with me. To install it, open atom and press `ctrl`-`,` (Control Comma) to open settings. In settings, open the install tab, search for teletype, and press install.

## Accounts to create

In addition to those tools, we will create a GitHub account to store our code and to set up the atom teletype plugin. You can make one at [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

## That's it!

If you completed the steps above, you're all set up for class. If you have questions or had trouble with one of the steps, you can text or email me for help.
