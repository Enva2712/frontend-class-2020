# Getting Started

## How this class will work
This class differs from most traditional schooling in two ways. The first is that rather than instruction, projects are at the core of this class, and the second is that due to Covid 19, this class will run in an asynchronous manner.

### Projects
As the internet has astronomically reduced the cost of replicating information, the amount that one knows has become a far less important factor than their ability to apply that information. In other words, it's more important to understand algebra than to have your times tables memorized. As such, this class focuses on teaching students how to acquire information on their own and apply it to solving a problem.

### Timing


## Your First Website
A webpage is an HTML file (text file) containing content surrounded by `tags`. A tag describes the content within it and lets you change how it's displayed. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) is a website that lets you experiment with webpages. In a new tab, try entering the following text into the HTML tab of the [codepen editor](https://codepen.io/pen).

```html
Hello World!
```

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

```html
<b>Hello World!</b>
```

The text inside the brackets is the tag name. Try using a `b` tag within an `h1` tag.

## Tools to Install

To edit websites on your computer, you just need a text editor. Most computers come with built in text editors, but to get features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete, we are going to install a text editor called atom. Atom runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and integrates with a tool called git that we will use to store different versions of our code. Installation instructions for atom and git can be found on their respective websites.

### Installation instructions:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* [atom](https://atom.io/)

### Atom plugins

The atom editor can be customized with plugins and themes. For this class we will only need the `teletype` plugin, which will allow you to share your coding environment with me. To install it, open atom and press `ctrl`-`,` (Control Comma) to open settings. In settings, open the install tab, search for teletype, and press install.

You can also install an editor theme if you want by selecting themes on the right side of the search bar and searching for one.

## Accounts to create

In addition to those tools, we will create a GitHub account to store our code and to set up the atom teletype plugin. You can make one at [github.com](https://github.com/join).

## That's it!

If you completed the steps above, you're all set up for class. If you have questions or had trouble with one of the steps, you can text or email me for help.
