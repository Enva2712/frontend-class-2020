# Putting Things Together

In this unit, you will learn to create an entire HTML document, link to CSS in another file, and write CSS selectors.

## Introduction

So far, the HTML you have written is just content; but websites also have metadata, or information about the content. To add metadata, we need to restructure our HTML. One type of metadata we can add is a link to an external CSS file that tells the browser how to style our HTML. To write CSS in another file though, we need to learn about CSS selectors, which tell the browser which HTML element to apply some CSS to.
