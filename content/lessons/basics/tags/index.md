# Basic HTML Tags

Content in HTML is described with tags. A tag is a bit of text inside angle brackets (`<` and `>`) that describes it's content. Tags look like `<tag>content</tag>`. A tag can either be opening or closing; and closing tags have a slash before the name to tell them apart. Tags are used to mark where an element begins and ends. In the example above, the first tag starts a `tag` element, and the second one ends it. HTML defines a number of elements, such as `h1` for heading 1, `p` for paragraph, and `a` for anchor (link). There are many more, but with these three you can begin to create simple web pages.

## Simple Webpage

Open atom and press `ctrl`-`n` to create a new tab. In this tab, create some HTML elements by opening a tag, typing some content, then closing the tag. Next, press `ctrl`-`s` to save the file, and name it `webpage.html`.

Now, find the file in File Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS, and open it in your web browser.
