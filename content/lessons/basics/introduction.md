# Introduction

The internet as a whole is complex, but the basics are pretty simple. At their core, websites can be thought of like folders and files on your computer. Each web page is an HTML file that a browser knows where to find and how to display. An HTML file can also link to files that tell the browser information about how to display parts of a page or code to run so a user can interact with a page in more complicated ways. These are CSS files and JavaScript files respectively. Files on the web are transferred using a protocol called HTTP. A protocol is just an agreed upon way for computers to communicate

Content in HTML is described with tags. A tag is just some text you put around content to say something about it. They look like `<tag>content</tag>`. The text inside the brackets is the tag name, and the part in between is the content. You can experiment with HTML on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen), a website that lets you experiment with HTML. Try using the `h1`, `i`, and `b` tags on codepen. For example, to use the h1 tag with the content `Learning HTML`, you would type `<h1>Learning HTML</h1>`.
