# Web Basics

In this unit, you will learn how data is transferred on the web, and how to add content and design to a webpage.

## Introduction

The internet as a whole is complex, but the basics are pretty simple. At their core, websites can be thought of like the folders and files on your computer. The URL that goes into your browser's search bar tells your browser who to ask for a file and what file to ask for. Each page is an HTML file that your browser knows how to display. An HTML file can also link to files that tell the browser how to display a page (CSS files) or code to run (JavaScript files) so a user can interact with a site in more complicated ways. Files on the web are transferred using a protocol called HTTP. A protocol is just a way for computers to talk to each other.
