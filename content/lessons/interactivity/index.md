# Interactive Websites

In this unit, you will learn to build interactive websites using JavaScript

## Introduction

So far, we have focused on showing content using HTML and CSS. By adding JavaScript, we can build websites that interact with their users. JavaScript is an imperative language; whereas HTML and CSS are declarative languages. In a declarative language, you write code that describes the output you want. The code directly represents the output; whereas in an imperative language, you write code that can create an output as it runs. The code creates the output based on how it was run.

JavaScript lets us change the HTML or CSS of a webpage as a user interacts with it. For example, we could use JavaScript to hide or show parts of a page, or even add content to a page.
